# Distributed Text Analysis Platform

## Project Overview

The Distributed Text Analysis Platform is designed to ingest large text files, process the data to extract insights (e.g., word frequency, sentiment analysis), and provide results through various interfaces. The platform utilizes a microservices architecture, handles large datasets efficiently, and leverages Go's pointers, concurrency, and interfaces with and without gRPC.

## Microservices

### 1. Text Ingestion Service

- **Functionality:**
  - Reads large text files from a specified source or accepts them via an HTTP API.
  - Efficiently handles large files by reading in chunks using pointers.
- **Implementation:**
  - Without gRPC.

### 2. Text Processing Service

- **Functionality:**
  - Performs various text analyses, including word frequency counting, sentiment analysis, and keyword extraction.
  - Communicates with other services via gRPC.
- **Implementation:**
  - With gRPC.

### 3. Data Aggregation Service

- **Functionality:**
  - Aggregates results from multiple text processing instances, combining insights into a comprehensive report.
- **Implementation:**
  - Uses gRPC for communication between services.

### 4. Report Generation Service

- **Functionality:**
  - Generates detailed reports based on aggregated data and provides access via a RESTful API.
- **Implementation:**
  - Without gRPC.

### 5. Monitoring & Analytics Service

- **Functionality:**
  - Tracks processing performance, error rates, and system health, offering monitoring dashboards and alerts.
- **Implementation:**
  - Without gRPC.

## Key Features

- **File Reading:**
  - Efficiently handle large text files using pointers, processing data in chunks to optimize memory usage.
- **Huge Data Handling:**
  - Leverage Go’s concurrency features (goroutines, channels) to handle large volumes of text data, processing multiple files simultaneously.
- **Interfaces:**
  - Implement interfaces for the Text Processing Service using both gRPC and RESTful API.
- **gRPC Integration:**
  - Utilize gRPC for inter-service communication in the Text Processing and Data Aggregation services.
- **Without gRPC:**
  - Implement RESTful APIs for the Text Ingestion, Report Generation, and Monitoring services.

## Implementation Plan

- **Day 1-2:**
  - Set up the project structure, design the text ingestion process, and build the Text Ingestion Service without gRPC.
- **Day 3:**
  - Develop the Text Processing Service with gRPC, focusing on text analysis algorithms.
- **Day 4-5:**
  - Implement the Data Aggregation Service with gRPC and the Report Generation Service without gRPC.
- **Day 6:**
  - Create the Monitoring & Analytics Service, integrating it with the existing services.
- **Day 7:**
  - Conduct thorough testing, optimize performance, and prepare for the interview (documentation, deployment setup, etc.).

## Conclusion

This project will give you experience with large-scale text processing, microservices architecture, gRPC, and Go’s handling of pointers and concurrency, making it a comprehensive preparation for your GoLang interview.
